##Bugs

* [x] After equal is pressed and next number is input it is added to result

* [x] Invalid is returned on first run if no first number is selected.
* [x] result displays with too many decimals for my liking.

* [x] if decimal is the first operand there is no 0 in front



##Solutions

*[x] check that OperatorType was set to
*[x] initialized new brain in view did load so that we had a brain object to perform operations
*[x]If neither operand has a decimal then display result as int. If either operand has a decimal then format the result with at least 2-4 decimals
*[x]checked that userIsTypingNumber is set to NO in operandTapped and set the Display to 0
